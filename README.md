# Bilkent University EEE 102 Term Project- Basic-Topographic-Map

The aim of my project is to distinguish between the height differences in a field, decide the highest one, measure its height and illustrate it on the 640x480 monitor by using VGA with colors that represent the different altitudes. The colors are based on the colors on a topographic map. My project determines the height of each location and reports them on the VGA screen. Also, the highest location and its altitude are written on the VGA screen binary.
